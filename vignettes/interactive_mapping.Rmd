4DModeller provides some simple map plotting functions that help you create maps from many different types of data.

In this tutorial we'll create plot our data using an interactive RShiny app. This lets us explore different layers of our data and have dynamic control over how it looks.

First we need to retrieve one of our tutorial datasets. This dataset contains data about rainfall near the [Kvilldal](https://www.statkraft.com/about-statkraft/where-we-operate/norway/kvilldal-hydropower-plant/) hydroelectric power plant in Southern Norway.

```{r}
fdmr::retrieve_tutorial_data(dataset = "hydro")
```
