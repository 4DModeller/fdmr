# 4D Modeller - Spatio-temporal modeling tools for the 21st Century

This repository contains the code for the 4DModeller project.

## Quickstart

To get 4D Modeller installed first you need to make sure you have a recent version of R installed.
The easiest way to do this is to [install RStudio](https://posit.co/downloads/).

Next start an R session and run

```R
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("4DModeller/fdmr")
```

Next we need to install INLA which is not available on CRAN.

```R
install.packages("INLA",repos=c(getOption("repos"),INLA="https://inla.r-inla-download.org/R/stable"), dep=TRUE)
```

You should now have `fdmr` and all its dependencies installed and you can continue on [one of our tutorials](https://4dmodeller.github.io/fdmr/articles/).
